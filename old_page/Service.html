		<ul>
		
		<li> Since moving to College station, I've been a two time participant in 
		<a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">the Big Event</a>
		, as well as a mentor for the <a href="https://reslife.tamu.edu/living/llcs/available/l3c/" target="_blank">L3C </a>
		.</li> <br>
		
		<li> Throughout my time living in Houston, I was a repeated volunteer at the 
		<a href="https://www.houstonfoodbank.org/ways-to-give/give-time/volunteerathfb/portwallwarehouse/" target="_blank">Houston Food Bank</a>. 
		I first volunteered before I was in high school, and the sheer need for raw manpower and unskilled labor struck me as 
		a perfect match for what I had to offer at the time.</li> <br>
		
		<li> Through my church, I've participated in multiple service trips to Southern Texas to build / repair houses, as well as smaller volunteer work helping
		those in my local area.</li>

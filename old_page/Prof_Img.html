  <p> I have been interested in computer engineering for multiple years now, and my interest in the field has driven my studies into the subject for just as long. My formal <br> 
		education in computer science started in 2014 with a class in Java, and electrical engineering followed the year after via the PLTW designed high school class. However, <br>
		since my admission to the computer engineering program at Texas A&M, I have gained many skills that will actually be useful in a professional environment. </p>
		<p> On the computer science side of my degree, I have completed multiple classes in C++, to the point where I would consider myself proficient, and I have completed classes <br> 
		based in HTML, Java, and Scheme. My personal project have also provided first steps into the worlds of Python and Javascript, but I have yet to demonstrate any sort of excellence <br> 
		in these languages in a structured sense. The electrical engineering side of my degree is where I have taken the greatest strides in terms of industry-useful knowledge and skills. <br>
		As of the most recent semester, I have completed the following courses: Microprocessor System Design, dealing with both linux kernel construction and communication protocols; <br> 
		and Computer Architecture and Design, dealing with both the physical components of the basic microprocessor, and execution of the ARM assembly language. </p>
		</p> As I continue to complete my required coursework and prepare to head into industry, I am looking for experience in any fields pertinent to what I have accomplished in my <br> 
		schooling. That being said, I am particularly interested in any opportunities involving the design and implementation of hardware, or the development and execution of assembly <br> 
		level programming. </p>
		<p> If you feel that any of the information listed on my website, <a href="Geyer_Resume.pdf" target="_blank"> my resume,</a> 
		or my potential application would make me a good fit for a position you are seeking to fill, please contact me at geyer.a20@gmail.com.

                <p> I have been interested in computer engineering for multiple years now, and my interest in the field has driven my studies into the subject for just as long. My formal 
					education in computer science started in 2014 with a class in Java, and electrical engineering followed the year after via the <a href="https://www.pltw.org/" target="blank">PLTW</a>
					designed high school class. Previous work experience from highschool are detailed in <a href="Geyer_Resume.pdf" target="_blank"> my resume.</a> However, since my admission to the 
					computer engineering program at Texas A&M, I have gained many skills that will be necessary in a professional environment. </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>On the computer science side of my degree, I have completed multiple classes in C++, to the point where I would consider myself proficient, and I have completed classes 
				based in  Java, and ARM assembly. My personal project have also provided first steps into the worlds of Python and Javascript, but I have yet to demonstrate any sort of excellence 
				in these languages in a structured sense. The electrical engineering side of my degree is where I have taken the greatest strides in terms of industry-useful knowledge and skills,
				as I have completed multiple classes regarding both electical design and base-level computer design / communication. </p>

				schooling. I feel that I am able to be a competent and productive worker in many positions, and I am  willing to move across the country to wherever my work would need me.
				That being said, I am particularly interested in any opportunities involving the design and implementation of hardware, or the development and execution of assembly 
				level programming. </p>

                <h3>Completed Coursework</h3>
                <p>As of the most recent semester, I have completed the following courses: Microprocessor System Design, dealing with both linux kernel construction and communication protocols; 
				and Computer Architecture and Design, dealing with both the physical components of the basic microprocessor, and execution of the ARM assembly language. After this current semester,
				I will have more hands-on experience with Scheme and HTML, as well as all requisite knowledge to begin my 
				<a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/academics/student-projects/capstone.html " target="_blank">capstone project</a>
				next year, the culmination of my degree at A&M.

				<a href="https://www.houstonfoodbank.org/ways-to-give/give-time/volunteerathfb/portwallwarehouse/" target="_blank">Houston Food Bank</a>. 
				I first volunteered before I was in high school, and the sheer need for raw manpower and unskilled labor struck me as 
				a perfect match for what I had to offer at the time.</li> <br>
		
				<li> Through my church, I've participated in multiple service trips to Southern Texas to build / repair houses, as well as smaller volunteer work helping
